**CCListView** is a highly customizable sequential view container. It can be configured to:

* optionally scroll contained content
* arrange content horizontally or vertically

You can build **CCListViews** that contain **CCListViews** (that contain **CCListViews**...) and they even support scrolling views within scrolling views.

Installation
---
**CCListView** is available through **[cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org)**, to install simple add the following line to your `PodFile`:

``` ruby
  pod "CCListView"
```

Alternatively you can clone the **[github repo](https://github.com/Codecademy/CCListView)**.

Setup
---
Once you've installed the class:

* Include the CCListView header

``` objective-c
    #import <CCListView/CCListView.h>
```

* From there you can either create your CCListView instance in Interface Builder (for now will default to vertical content and scrolling enabled) or in code by using:


``` objective-c
	CCListView *listView = [ [CCListView alloc] initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame horizontal:(BOOL)horizontal scrolling:(BOOL)scrolling];
```

Passing `YES` into `horizontal` will result in content being arranged horizontally left to right, passing `NO` will result in content being arranged vertically from top to bottom.

Passing `YES` into `scrolling` will enable scrolling within your list view, passing `NO` will disable scrolling.

* From here you can add, insert, and remove content views as well as customize further behaviors of the list view. For now please check out the class interface declared in `CCListView.h` to learn what's available!

**CCListView** is a simple utility class, as such the class interface has largely been built out of need.

Or suggest a pull request!
